Overview

I originally attempted to have the colour of the cow (texture file) change based on the selected cube, and in one js file. This didn't work.
I also originally attempted to have multiple farm animals selectable with a set of four spheres to the left, and colours on four cubes to the right.
These objects didn't look right in the end and I just went with the cow object from class.

Also it turns out my screen capture software doesn't do audio. Whoops.

What did work, was the background music.
Originally, I couldn't find anything online that allowed me to have an automatically-playing background track using a-frame.
I eventually just stuck a sound file on the skydome, and basically placed at the origin. 
Not a perfect solution, but it works until I have a better option.
